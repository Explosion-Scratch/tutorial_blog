# Starting JavaScript
So I assume that this is your first time learning JavaScript! I'm excited for you! JavaScript is the world's most used programming language, and it can run on _any_ browser in the world! It has lots of power, it can do anything from making webpages interactive to data visualization! Throughout this course I'll show you how to start out, and how to learn new things, as well as useful resources to look at when you're stuck!

## Part 1: Hello world
Hello world is the start of programming in any language, in Python, that's `print("Hello world")`, in HTML it's `<h1>Hello world</h1>` and the list goes on. To do hello world in JavaScript you can simply type the following into your console:
```js
alert("Hello world");
```

<summary>Help me, what is console</summary>
Console is a super useful feature built into most browsers, to use it simply press Control + Shift + J in chrome, then navigate to the console tab! Console is the tab you just navigated to, the developer tools is the whole thing. With developer tools you can look at the code for any website, and execute JavaScript code on it to change it somehow!

Congrats! You did it!
