# JavaScript syntax and methods
To begin learning JavaScript it is first important to understand the basic syntax of the language, such as objects, strings, arrays and numbers.

In JavaScript there are a bunch of different primitives, primitives are the building blocks of the language.

## Objects:
Objects hold data in a value-key method:
```js
//Make sure to put a comma after each key value pair, otherwise you'll get a syntax error.
let something = {
	key: "Value!",
	anotherKey: "It's value",
	"Key's can have spaces in them": "Just enclose them in quotes",
	keys_dont_have_to_be_strings: new Date(),
	keys_can_be_objects: {
		nested: "key",
		anotherNested: "key",
	}
}
```
Then you can access parts of the object you just created like this:
```js
console.log(something.key);//This logs "Value!" to the console.
console.log(something.keys_can_be_objects.nested)//This logs "key" to the console, getting it from the nested part of the object we made
```

## Strings
Strings are basically text. You can interact with them, store information in them and much more.
```js
let variable = "This is a string";
let anotherString = 'This is also a string';
let yetAnotherStringLol = `This is a different string, but we can put another string inside it: This is 'variable': ${variable}`
//Now yetAnotherStringLol is "This is a different string, but we can put another string inside it: This is 'variable': This is a string"
```

## Functions
Functions run peices of code, and are useful for reusing code and making it more readable. you can `return` information from a function, or just run it. Let's say that you wanted to calculate a number multiplied by 3, but it took a bunch of code to do this:
```js
function timesThree(aNumber){
	return aNumber * 3;//This returns the number times 3.
}
//Now we can use that function:
console.log(timesThree(5));//Logs the number 15 to the console

//In this specific case it'd be much easier to simply do this:
console.log(5 * 3);
//But functions extend to much more complicated things, and can even be used in other functions!
```

## Numbers
These work as expected: 
```js
let aNumber = 123;
console.log(123 + 2);//125
```

## Arrays
Arrays are lists. They can have anything as their items and are really useful.
```js
let anArray = ["first","second","third"];
//Now because of the way that JavaScript works, index 0 f an array is the first item =|
console.log(anArray[0]);//"first"
console.log(anArray[1]);//"second"
console.log(anArray.length);//3, anArray has 3 items.
```
There are lots more different types of items in JS but that's all you need to know for now
